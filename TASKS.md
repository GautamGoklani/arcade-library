# Open tasks

Everything known to be outstanding, in one place. [`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md) is
how the repository works; this is what is left to do in it.

Two rules for keeping this file honest:

- **A task is only here if it is real.** Not "would be nice" — something that is
  missing, unverified, or inconsistent, with enough detail to act on cold.
- **Delete tasks when they are done.** A backlog that only grows stops being
  read. The git history is the record of what was finished.

New games are *not* tracked here; they live in
[`games/plans-for-other-games.md`](games/plans-for-other-games.md). **Every
concept on that list has now shipped** — anything new from here is a new idea
rather than a backlog item.

## 1 · Library goals not built

### Pixel Wave's own roadmap — *product decisions*

Power-ups, boss waves, gamepad support. Listed in full at the bottom of
[`games/plans-for-other-games.md`](games/plans-for-other-games.md). Sound,
pause, difficulty settings and per-species enemy behaviour are done. Each of
the rest changes what the game *is*, so they are for the owner to choose
between rather than for anyone to work through in order.

## 2 · Documentation

Nothing outstanding, but three things are deliberate and should not be "fixed":

- **Chapters 6, 7 and 17 teach from Vector Arena**, which was removed from the
  repository in `e90bc03`. The material stayed because those three techniques —
  the import index space, shipping a bare engine, closest-approach dodging —
  appear nowhere else in the course, and the code is quoted in full. Each says
  so inline.
- **Three engines have no chapter.** Grid Breaker arrived after the first
  seventeen were written; Starfield Runner and Tower Defense Lite are worked
  variations on ideas chapters 21 and 16 already cover, and a chapter that
  restates one is worse than no chapter. All three are documented at length by
  their own READMEs, and `docs/README.md` says which and why.
- **`docs/reference/*.docx` describe an old balance.** They are historical
  records, kept unconverted on purpose;
  [`docs/reference/README.md`](docs/reference/README.md) lists the corrections.
